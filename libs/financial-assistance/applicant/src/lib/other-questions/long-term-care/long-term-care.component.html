    Activities of daily living include basic functions that most people do
    without help every day, like eating, dressing, bathing, going to the
    bathroom, continence and transferring. Transferring includes activities like
    walking, or getting in and out of a bed, chair or wheelchair. People who
    need help with activities of daily living, and also meet certain income
    limits, may qualify for additional services under Medicaid.
