    We need to know if this person will be claimed by anyone as a tax dependent,
    to see if they qualify for monthly premium reductions, lower out-of-pocket
    costs, or Medicaid. We need to know who plans to claim this person as a tax
    dependent for the year they get coverage, even if that person has not
    claimed them as a dependent in the past. The person who claims a tax
    dependent is responsible for making sure the dependent has health insurance.

    This list shows all the tax filers you’ve listed on the application so far.
    If you haven’t added the tax filer who plans to claim this person to the
    application yet, you can come back and answer this question after you have
    added that person. You must tell us about about everyone listed on the tax
    return of someone who claims an applicant as a dependent to determine
    whether the dependent qualifies for monthly premium reductions, lower
    out-of-pocket costs, or Medicaid.
