## Quick Start & Documentation

## Development server

### Console (Carrier Portal)

Run `nx serve console` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4205/`. Carrier Portal requires the console local server app to be running alongside it.

To run the console app, open a new terminal and run `npm start` from the root directory. The console app must be installed adjacent to the enroll app in the file system. If the console app is not installed, [clone it from github](https://github.com/ideacrew/console) into the console directory and follow the directions in the README.md file to install it.

### Enroll

Run `nx serve enroll` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

**NOTE**: For all nx apps, the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
